                        <p>Everything along the way, to and from, fascinated her: every pebble, ant, stick, leaf, blade
                            of
                            grass, and crack in the sidewalk was something to be picked up, looked at, tasted, smelled,
                            and
                            shaken. Everything was interesting to her. She knew nothing. I knew everything…been there,
                            done
                            that. She was in the moment, I was in the past. She was mindful. I was mindless.
